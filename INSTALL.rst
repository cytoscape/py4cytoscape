Install
=======

.. note::
   This section pertains to executing Python from a command line, with the Python program importing ``py4cytoscape``
   and then using its functions to call Cytoscape. If you intend to run Python in a Jupyter Notebook instead,
   the installation instructions are much simpler, and can be found in the
   `Jupyter Notebook section <https://py4cytoscape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#jupyter-notebook>`_ of the
   Concepts chapter. The section below doesn't apply to you.

.. note::
   The quickest and easiest way to see ``py4cytoscape`` in action is by following the Quick Start instructions.

``py4cytoscape`` requires Python 3.9 or later.  If you do not already
have a Python environment configured on your computer, please see the
instructions for installing the full `scientific Python stack
<https://scipy.org/install.html>`_.

.. note::
   If you are on Windows and want to install optional packages (e.g., `scipy`),
   then you will need to install a Python distributions such as
   `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_,
   `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy>`_,
   `Python(x,y) <http://python-xy.github.io/>`_,
   `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_, or
   `Pyzo <http://www.pyzo.org/>`_.
   If you use one of these Python distribution, please refer to their online
   documentation.

   `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ and other integrated development
   environments often install their own Python distributions.

Below we assume you have a suitable Python environment already configured on
your computer and you intend to install ``py4cytoscape`` inside of it.  If you want
to create and work with Python virtual environments, please follow instructions
on `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ and `virtual
environments <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_.

First, make sure you have the latest version of ``pip`` (the Python package manager)
installed. If you do not, refer to the `Pip documentation
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ and install ``pip`` first.

Cytoscape Prerequisite
----------------------

To exercise ``py4cytoscape``, you must first have downloaded, installed, and
executed Cytoscape. If you have not already done this, please refer to the `Launching
Cytoscape <http://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/Launching_Cytoscape.html#launching-cytoscape>`_
instructions.

.. note::
   These instructions assume Cytoscape and ``py4cytoscape`` are running on the same
   workstation or virtual machine. ``py4cytoscape`` communicates with Cytoscape
   via a localhost (127.0.0.1) connection, which precludes ``py4cytoscape`` from
   accessing Cytoscape remotely.

   To overcome this limitation, you can execute your Python/``py4cytoscape`` workflow
   on a remote Jupyter Notebook server (e.g., `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_
   or `GenePattern Notebook <https://notebook.genepattern.org/hub>`_)
   as described in
   the `Jupyter Notebook <https://py4cytoscape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#jupyter-notebook>`_ section.

Install the latest version (Python Console)
------------------------------------------------

Install the *current* release of ``py4cytoscape`` with ``pip``::

   pip install igraph requests pandas networkx colorbrewer chardet decorator backoff colour
   pip install py4cytoscape


Install the development version (Python Console)
------------------------------------------------

To install the *latest* py4cytoscape development version, instead
of ``pip install py4cytoscape``, use::

   pip install igraph requests pandas networkx colorbrewer chardet decorator backoff colour
   pip install git+https://github.com/cytoscape/py4cytoscape.git
   
To install the py4cytoscape branch (for example 0.0.10) version, instead
of ``pip install py4cytoscape``, use::

   pip install igraph requests pandas networkx colorbrewer chardet decorator backoff colour
   pip install git+https://github.com/cytoscape/py4cytoscape.git@0.0.10

Alternately, to install *a particular* py4cytoscape development version (e.g., 0.0.11), instead
of ``pip install py4cytoscape``, use::

   pip install igraph requests pandas networkx colorbrewer chardet decorator backoff colour
   git clone git://github.com/cytoscape/py4cytoscape@0.0.11

Verify Cytoscape connection
---------------------------

To verify that ``py4cytoscape`` is properly installed and able to communicate with
Cytoscape, execute the following in a Python Console (after starting Cytoscape)::

   import py4cytoscape as py4
   dir(py4)
   py4.cytoscape_ping()
   py4.cytoscape_version_info()

This will import ``py4cytoscape`` into the Python namespace, print a (long) list
of ``py4cytoscape`` entrypoints, and then demonstrate a connection to Cytoscape
by collecting Cytoscape information.

Sanity Testing (command line)
----------------------

``py4cytoscape`` uses the Python ``unittest`` testing package. You can learn more
about ``unittest`` on its `homepage <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_.

To execute tests from an OS command line, set the current directory to
the ``py4cytoscape`` package directory. Then, establish the execution environment::

   cd py4cytoscape
   cd tests
   set PYTHONPATH=..

.. note::
   You must start Cytoscape *before* executing any tests.

Executing just a sanity test takes only a few minutes::

    runsanitytests.bat

You should be able to see Cytoscape load small networks and manipulate them.

You can also try the Quick Start instructions in `Tutorials <https://py4cytoscape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html#quick_start>`_ section.

Deep testing (command line)
---------------------------

The main ``py4cytoscape`` test suite consists of a number of sub-suites. Executing all
of them can take an hour or two, depending on your workstation.

To execute all tests that don't require user interaction, establish the environment (if you haven't already done so)::

   cd py4cytoscape
   cd tests
   set PYTHONPATH=..

.. note::
   You must start Cytoscape *before* executing any tests.

Run all test sub-suites::

   runalltests.bat

Note that ``runalltests`` executes without any console output. Instead, it sends normal console
output to the ``cons`` file, and standard error output to the ``err`` file. The ``err``
contains normal test failures, but also contains a summary report of any failures once
all tests have been run.

Executing one or two tests is relatively quick. To execute a single sub-suite
(e.g., ``test_apps.py``)::

   python -m unittest test_apps.py

To execute more than one sub-suite (e.g., ``test_apps.py`` and ``test_filters.py``)::

   python -m unittest test_apps.py test_filters.py

To execute all sub-suites::

   python -m unittest

To execute a single test (e.g., test_get_app_information) in a single sub-suite::

   python -m unittest test_apps.AppsTests.test_get_app_information
   python -m unittest test_tools.ToolsTests.test_network_merge

.. note::
   To send test output to a file, redirect stderr and console::

      python -m unittest 2>stderr.log 1>cons.log

.. note::
   Some tests require console input, and without console prompts, the tests will
   appear to stall. To avoid executing such tests, set the PY4CYTOSCAPE_SKIP_UI_TESTS
   environment variable described below.

.. note::
   To execute tests with less console debug output, set this environment
   variable before executing tests::

      set PY4CYTOSCAPE_SUMMARY_LOGGER=FALSE

   To further configure logging, see the :ref:`Logging` file.

.. note::
   To execute tests without showing test names as tests execute, set this
   environment variable before executing the tests::

      set PY4CYTOSCAPE_SHOW_TEST_PROGRESS=FALSE

.. note::
   To skip execution of tests that require user input, set this environment
   variable before executing tests::

      set PY4CYTOSCAPE_SKIP_UI_TESTS=TRUE

.. note::
    When executing a large number of tests, we recommend that all three
    environment variables be set as described above.

.. note::
    When executing tests in PyCharm, you can set environment
    variables using the ``Run | Edit Configurations...`` menu item.
